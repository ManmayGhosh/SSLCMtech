1.  Bookings.h
tell me in the entire page whats the use of
#ifndef BOOKINGS_H
#define BOOKINGS_H
#include <stdbool.h>
#endif

These lines are called header guards and a standard library include. Here’s what each does:

1. #ifndef BOOKINGS_H and #define BOOKINGS_H
Purpose: Prevents the contents of this header file from being included multiple times in a single compilation unit.
How:
#ifndef BOOKINGS_H checks if BOOKINGS_H is not defined.
If not, it defines BOOKINGS_H and includes the file’s contents.
If already defined, the file’s contents are skipped.
Why is this important?
Including a header multiple times can cause redefinition errors. Header guards solve this.

2. #include <stdbool.h>
Purpose: Allows you to use the bool type and the true/false constants in C.
Why:
C did not originally have a boolean type.
Including this header makes code clearer and safer.
3. #endif
Purpose: Closes the conditional started by #ifndef.
